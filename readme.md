A long-term ML journey built notebook by notebook — pure consistency, pure curiosity, pure hard work.  
Every week I added a little more, learned something new, and slowly stacked up a full collection of machine learning projects that _actually_ do something.

All projects are `.ipynb` files and can be ported into a **Django REST API**.  
Once wrapped as endpoints → they run 24/7, powering any frontend in any language.
All projects are future-proof

# 🔧 Tech Design

- All projects are deployable via **Django REST API**    
- Written as colab notebooks to save hard-disk memory when doing multiple pip installs for each project
-  ML models can be exported as pickle or joblib as and when necessary
- Build the backend in Python and expose its REST API and it shall run in any front-end no matter what technology comes tomorrow is the basic philosophy. Connect the backend REST API to the front end and it shall run 24/7 like clockwork. 
- 🚀 Everything is future-proof.

# 💬 Final Note

This repo is not meant to look fancy — it’s meant to show a **consistent journey** and **pure hardwork** , built week after week.

Now updated new readme.md with better structure, badges, and hyperlinks, it carries the same weight as the effort behind it.
